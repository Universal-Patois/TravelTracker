# Travel Tracker Application

Mod 2 Final Solo Project - Design an app that can a user's travel using a API. I took inspiration from websites from the 90's and tried to style it in that sense.

## How to Use
When a user visits the site they will see a login page. After the user enters the right credentials(username and password) the user will be taken to their dashboard. On the dashboard the user will be able to see their past, upcoming, and pending trips. As well, their yearly spending on travel will be displayed.

## How to Install
1. `fork` [this](https://github.com/Jerry-Vrrr/travel-tracker) repository
2. `git clone` it down to your command line
3. Navigate into the repository on your machine
4. Run `npm install`

5. `git clone` [this](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/webpack-starter-kit) travel api repo
6. Run `npm install`

7. To view the site, run `npm start` in both repos

## How to login to the site:
Username: traveler + any number 1 - 50 eg, <br> `Login: traveler25` <br>
`Password: travel`

## Technologies Used
1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS
3. WebPack
4. Chai & Mocha
5. Local Server API

## Project Planning
The detailed spec for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Universal-Patois/projects/5/views/1) <br>

## Future Iterations
* I want to develop the travel agent view for the app with the capability to approve or deny trip requests.  
* Enabling the user to request suggested activities from the agent.
* Implement a npm like glide.js to make the display of user trips more modern/appealing.
